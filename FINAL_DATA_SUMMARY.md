## 🎯 Training Recommendations

### Data Split Strategy

For the 5-year dataset, recommended split:

```python
# Time-based split (NEVER random for time series!)

Training:    Oct 2020 - Jun 2024  (~3.7 years, 74%)
             ~1,260,000 candles

Validation:  Jul 2024 - Sep 2024  (~3 months, 16%)
             ~273,000 candles

Test:        Oct 2024 - Oct 2025  (~1 year, 10%)
             ~172,000 candles
```

### Why This Split Is Good

✅ **Training set includes:**
- COVID recovery
- 2021-2022 bull market
- 2022 bear market
- 2023 recovery
- Early 2024 growth

✅ **Validation set:**
- Recent market conditions (2024)
- For hyperparameter tuning

✅ **Test set:**
- Most recent year
- For final evaluation
- Represents "future" the model will see

### Feature Engineering Ideas

With 1-minute data, you can create:

**Technical Indicators:**
```python
# Price-based
- SMA/EMA (5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 200 periods)
- RSI (14 periods)
- MACD
- Bollinger Bands
- ATR (Average True Range)

# Volume-based
- Volume moving averages
- Volume spikes
- Volume-weighted price

# Pattern recognition
- Support/resistance levels
- Breakouts
- Reversals
```

**Multi-timeframe Features:**
```python
# Aggregate to higher timeframes
- 5-minute aggregates
- 15-minute aggregates
- Hourly aggregates
- Daily aggregates

# This gives models multi-scale context
```

**Time-based Features:**
```python
- Hour of day (0-23)
- Day of week (0-6)
- Is market open (binary)
- Minutes from market open/close
- Session indicator (Asia/Europe/US)
```

## 💾 Loading the Data

### Python Example

```python
import pandas as pd
import json

# Method 1: Load all at once
data = []
with open('data/bronze/prices/spx500_usd_m1_5years.ndjson', 'r') as f:
    for line in f:
        if line.strip():
            data.append(json.loads(line))

df = pd.DataFrame(data)
df['time'] = pd.to_datetime(df['time'])
df = df.sort_values('time')

print(f"Loaded {len(df):,} candles")
print(f"Date range: {df['time'].min()} to {df['time'].max()}")
```

### Memory-Efficient Streaming

```python
# Method 2: Stream processing (for large datasets)
def process_candles(file_path, chunk_size=100000):
    """Process candles in chunks to save memory."""
    chunk = []

    with open(file_path, 'r') as f:
        for i, line in enumerate(f):
            if line.strip():
                chunk.append(json.loads(line))

                if len(chunk) >= chunk_size:
                    # Process this chunk
                    df_chunk = pd.DataFrame(chunk)
                    yield df_chunk
                    chunk = []

        # Process remaining
        if chunk:
            yield pd.DataFrame(chunk)

# Usage
for chunk_df in process_candles('data/bronze/prices/spx500_usd_m1_5years.ndjson'):
    # Process each chunk
    print(f"Processing {len(chunk_df)} candles...")
```
