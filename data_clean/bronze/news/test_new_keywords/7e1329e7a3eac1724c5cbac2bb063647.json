  "body": "ByTrefis Team,\nContributor.\nRTX (NYSE: RTX) is scheduled to announce its earnings on Tuesday, October 21, 2025. Traditionally, RTX stock has exhibited a pattern of a negative one-day return in the aftermath of its earnings announcements. Throughout the last five years, the stock has decreased on 55% of the days immediately succeeding an earnings release. These negative returns have an average value of -1.6%, with a maximum one-day drop recorded at -10.2%.\nFor traders focused on events, recognizing these historical trends can serve as a significant advantage, although the immediate stock response is greatly influenced by how the actual outcomes line up with market expectations and consensus.\nThere are two main strategies to capitalize on this information:\nThe market consensus predicts RTX will reveal earnings of $1.41 per share with sales totaling $21.32 billion. This stands in contrast to the results from the same quarter last year, which reported earnings of $1.45 per share on sales of $20.09 billion.\nFinancially, the company holds a current market capitalization of $211 billion. In the past twelve months, RTX generated $84 billion in revenue, reporting $8.3 billion in operating profits and a net income of $6.1 billion.\nHowever, if you are looking for potential upside with reduced volatility compared to holding individual stocks, consider the High Quality Portfolio. It has significantly outperformed its benchmark—a composite of the S&P 500, Russell, and S&P MidCap indices—and has generated returns exceeding 105% since its inception. What is the reason for this? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks delivered superior returns with lower risk compared to the benchmark index; it is a smoother ride, as demonstrated in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.\nView the earnings reaction history of all stocks\nAdditional data for recorded 5-Day (5D) and 21-Day (21D) returns after earnings are summarized along with the statistics in the table below.\nA relatively lower-risk strategy (although not effective if the correlation is low) involves examining the correlation between short-term and medium-term returns post earnings, identifying a pair that demonstrates the highest correlation, and executing the appropriate trade. For instance, if 1D and 5D exhibit the highest correlation, a trader could position themselves as “long” for the next 5 days if the 1D post-earnings return is favorable. Here is some correlation data based on a 5-year and a 3-year (more recent) history. Note that correlation 1D_5D refers to the correlation between 1D post-earnings returns and the subsequent 5D returns.\nInvesting in a single stock without thorough analysis can be perilous. Consider the Trefis Reinforced Value (RV) Portfolio, which has outperformed its all-cap stock benchmark (a combination of the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000 benchmark indices) to deliver robust returns for investors. Why is that? The quarterly rebalanced mix of large-, mid-, and small-cap RV Portfolio stocks offered an agile way to capitalize on positive market conditions while mitigating losses when markets decline, as outlined in RV Portfolio performance metrics.",
