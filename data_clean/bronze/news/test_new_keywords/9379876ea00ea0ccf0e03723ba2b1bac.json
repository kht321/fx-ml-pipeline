It has exceeded or met analysts’ earnings estimates in three of the past four quarters, while missing on one occasion.\nFor the full year 2026, analysts expect MCHP to report EPS of $1.18, up 16.8% from $1.01 in fiscal 2025.

The company has also been relying on stock offerings, which raised dilution concerns among investors.\nAdditionally, it is undergoing restructuring, including job cuts and the shutdown or sale of certain fabrication assets to counter a steep decline in demand and excess inventory. The company’s revenues and margins have also weakened amid sluggish demand. Also, broader macro pressures like concerns around trade tensions are also weighing on the stock.\nWall Street analysts are moderately bullish about MCHP’s stock, with a “Moderate Buy” rating overall. Among 25 analysts covering the stock, 16 suggest a “Strong Buy,” one recommends a “Moderate Buy,” and eight recommend a “Hold.” MCHP’s mean price target of $76.88 indicates a potential upswing of 17.6% from the current market price.\nOn the date of publication, Sristi Jayaswal did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.
